But genau used in a sarcastic/ironic/sardonic voice has to be translated differently. Often the last syllable is signalling hysterical content by being raised, more melodic than usual and/or somewhat stretched. Or like @Marv commented: "The second is also true when it‘s spoken something like ‚genauuu‘ (or „ge-nauuu“), meaning with a dragged out ‚u‘."

In that case it is more or of the "Yeah, right" or "can't be serious", or even "you're pulling my leg!", "nonsense". Then it is not "exactly", but the exact opposite!
