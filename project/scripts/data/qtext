I made a month/season counter which after a button is pressed changes the name of a var to a specific month and season (the season is underneath) the whole thing is on the right side of the screen with float right and some position adjustments with margin-right and so when it comes to "summer" the whole thing moves a bit to the left instead on the right as it did previously without adding "float: right" and "margin-right". I don´t really know how to fix it and I don´t think that somehow changing the position for each specific season/month is the right answer. I am thankful for any help.
